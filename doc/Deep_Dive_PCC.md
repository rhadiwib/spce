### **1. Data Needed for the PCC Dashboard**

#### **A. Core Operational Data**

1.  **Real-Time Vehicle Monitoring**:
    *   **Number of vehicles** in each parking area, entry/exit lane, and buffer zone.
    *   **Vehicle type**: Private cars, logistics trucks, buses, etc., to prioritize flow management.
    *   **Source**: IoT sensors, ANPR cameras, and Automated Vehicle Marshalling (AVM) systems with LED guidance.

2.  **Dock Status**:
    *   Dock availability, vessel berthing times, and loading/unloading duration.
    *   **Source**: IoT sensors (LiDAR, radar) to monitor dock and vessel conditions.

3.  **Vessel ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival)**:
    *   Real-time vessel location via AIS (Automatic Identification System), speed, and estimated arrival time.
    *   **Source**: Integration with global maritime tracking systems and vessel GPS sensors.

4.  **Weather and Sea Conditions**:
    *   Wind speed, wave height, visibility, and weather predictions for the next 2–3 hours.
    *   **Source**: Local weather stations and satellite data (e.g., from national meteorological agencies like BMKG or NOAA).

5.  **CCTV Feeds**:
    *   Live video from critical areas: docks, parking lots, and buffer zones for security and operational surveillance [artikel_kapal_feri.md].

#### **B. Predictive and Simulation Data**

1.  **Congestion Prediction**:
    *   AI models (e.g., LSTM, Random Forest) that predict surges in vehicle and vessel volume based on historical data, national holidays, and ticket purchasing trends.
    *   **Input**: Data from the Ferizy App (slot booking), weather forecasts, and highway traffic (e.g., Tangerang-Merak Toll Road).

2.  **Crisis Simulation (Digital Twin)**:
    *   A virtual representation of the port using tools like Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation or Unity 3D to simulate scenarios such as dock closures or storms.

#### **C. Other Supporting Data**

1.  **Ship Engine Sensors**:
    *   Data on vibration, temperature, and pressure from ship engines for predictive maintenance.
2.  **Queue Management Data**:
    *   Wait times in each lane, vehicle distribution by destination, and loading/unloading efficiency.
3.  **External Data**:
    *   Highway traffic information (via Google Maps API), satellite weather data, and emergency notifications (e.g., for earthquakes or tsunamis).

### **2. How to Present Data on the PCC Dashboard**

#### **A. Real-Time Visualization**

1.  **Main Display (Central Dashboard)**:
    *   A **180° Curved Display Wall** with 48 monitors to display primary data:
        *   A port map with a heatmap showing vehicle and vessel density.
        *   Dynamic charts for vehicle counts, dock status, and vessel ETAs.
        *   KPI (Key Performance Indicators) widgets for metrics like average loading/unloading time, traveler satisfaction rates, and system downtime.

2.  **Grafana/Kibana Integration**:
    *   Visualization of IoT data (e.g., ship engine vibrations, air quality) in time-series graphs and with alert thresholds.
    *   Example: A notification stating, "Vessel X engine temperature exceeds safe limit (120°C)."

3.  **Real-Time Maps**:
    *   Integration with the Google Maps API to display conditions on toll roads and in buffer zones (e.g., "Rest Area KM 43 is full").

#### **B. Prediction and Simulation**

1.  **Alerts & Notifications**:
    *   An automated alarm system to predict congestion 2–3 hours in advance (e.g., "Dock 3 will be at full capacity at 14:00").
    *   Notifications sent to the Ferizy App to direct travelers to alternative time slots.

2.  **Interactive Simulation**:
    *   A Digital Twin with a drag-and-drop interface to simulate the impact of a dock closure or a storm. Results are displayed in a "Before vs. After Mitigation" graph.

3.  **AI-Powered Queue Optimization**:
    *   A visual display of vehicle flow with color-coding (green = smooth, red = congested) and recommendations for dynamic lane allocation.

#### **C. Customization & User Roles**

1.  **Personalized Widgets**:
    *   Port operators can customize widgets based on their roles (e.g., the technical team focuses on sensor data, while managers focus on economic KPIs) [web_search_3].
2.  **Multi-Level Access**:
    *   Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive data (e.g., only senior operators can view vessel maintenance data).

### **3. Details Often Overlooked or Needing Improvement**

#### **A. Data Governance & Interoperability**

1.  **Data Quality Assessment (DQA)**:
    *   Implementation of tools like Apache Spark ML to clean noisy AIS data (which can have 15–30% noise) and H3 Geospatial Indexing for anomaly detection.
2.  **Interoperability Standards**:
    *   Adoption of ISO 11064 (for command centers) and IEEE 2413-2019 (for IoT integration) to ensure all systems (Ferizy App, PCC, ANPR) can communicate seamlessly.

#### **B. Cybersecurity Framework**

1.  **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)**:
    *   Implementation of biometric authentication (e.g., facial recognition) and AES-256 encryption to protect passenger and port operational data.
2.  **Routine Penetration Testing**:
    *   Conducting network security tests every 6 months to identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited [web_search_5].

#### **C. Sustainability Metrics**

1.  **Renewable Energy Module**:
    *   Integration of data on solar energy production (from panels on terminal roofs) and wind turbines into the dashboard to track carbon emission reductions.
2.  **Carbon Accounting Software**:
    *   Use of tools like SAP Green Ledger to calculate and report the port's operational carbon footprint.

#### **D. User Experience & Training**

1.  **AR/VR Simulator**:
    *   Training for port operators using tools like Microsoft HoloLens to simulate emergency scenarios (e.g., evacuating a stalled vessel).
2.  **Mobile Access**:
    *   A PCC Mobile application for real-time monitoring from mobile devices, with push notifications for critical events [web_search_7].
