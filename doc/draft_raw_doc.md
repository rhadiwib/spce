Smart Port Ecosystem: Keys to Success
The successful integration and beneficial operation of a Smart Port Ecosystem, particularly in the context of Indonesia's ferry services, hinges on several key success factors. These factors extend beyond mere technological implementation to encompass governance, human adaptation, and policy innovation [1-9].
The critical success factors can be broadly categorized into three fundamental pillars:
•
Leadership and Governance [4, 9]:
◦
Strong political commitment for long-term investment in the transformation of the entire ecosystem [4, 9-16]. This indicates that the initiative is a marathon, not a sprint, requiring sustained effort [10-15].
◦
Establishment of a multi-stakeholder governance structure, such as a National Ferry Coordination Committee chaired by the Deputy Minister of Transportation and including representatives from ASDP, Port Authority, Police, Navy, and Local Government. This committee would be responsible for policy coordination, crisis management, and performance oversight [17-19]. Technical Working Groups are also suggested for specific areas like Technology Integration, Operations Optimization, Customer Experience, and Safety & Security [19, 20].
◦
Performance-based management with clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and consequences [4, 9].
◦
Fostering a continuous improvement culture driven by data-based decisions [4, 9]. Leveraging the "goldmine" of data from applications like Ferizy and daily operations for predictive analytics is crucial for accurate demand forecasting and efficient resource allocation [1, 2, 5-8].
◦
Political will and uncompromising rule enforcement are necessary for mandatory slot compliance and vehicle filtering in buffer zones [1, 2, 5-8].
•
Technology and Innovation [9, 21]:
◦
Deployment of a robust system architecture that is scalable and resilient to handle increasing demands and dynamic conditions [9, 21].
◦
Emphasis on data-driven operations with real-time decision support, allowing for proactive congestion prevention rather than reactive crisis management [9, 21-25].
◦
A customer-centric design with an intuitive user experience for all digital platforms, such as the Ferizy Super App [9, 21].
◦
Adherence to international standard compliance for interoperability across various systems and platforms [9, 21].
◦
Strategic choices in technology, including proven vendors with Southeast Asian experience, prioritizing seamless integration with existing operations, planning for scalable growth, and establishing local partnerships for ongoing support [3, 26].
•
Change Management and Adoption [21, 27]:
◦
Implementation of comprehensive training programs for all stakeholders, including port operators using technologies like AR/VR simulators for emergency scenarios [21, 27-29].
◦
Incentive alignment to encourage behavioral change among staff and customers [21, 27].
◦
Excellence in communication through massive and continuous public education campaigns to foster public acceptance and encourage planning journeys, purchasing tickets in advance, and adhering to time slots [1, 2, 5-8, 27].
◦
Continuous stakeholder engagement including co-creation workshops to integrate feedback and address potential resistance to change from staff and customers [27, 30, 31]. This is crucial to avoid delays in adoption and maintain customer satisfaction [30, 31].
In essence, the transformation from reactive crisis management to proactive travel orchestration, supported by an end-to-end Smart Port Ecosystem, demands not only significant investment in hardware and software but also strong political will, strict rule enforcement, and public participation to change long-standing behaviors [1, 2, 5-8, 10, 11, 13-15, 32]. Success in digital transformation, as seen with the Ferizy app, provides hope, but robust safety enforcement must evolve in parallel with technological advancements [33].
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI Vessel Prediction: Overcoming Data Challenges
One significant challenge in current approaches to advanced AI, particularly in the context of vessel trajectory prediction, is Data Heterogeneity & Quality [1]. Raw AIS (Automatic Identification System) data, which is crucial for these predictions, can contain between 15-30% noise or missing values [1]. This issue arises from various factors, including VHF interference, signal collisions in busy port areas, and irregular sampling intervals, all of which directly impact the accuracy and reliability of AI models [1].
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AI Integration: Regulation, Acceptance, and Safeguards for Smart Ports
To address AI's inherent risks and ensure its beneficial integration within the Smart Port Ecosystem, several regulatory and societal approaches are proposed, focusing on policy, human adaptation, and ethical safeguards:
Regulatory Framework and Policy Support
A fundamental pillar for successful AI integration is a robust regulatory framework and strong political commitment [1-6]. This involves a paradigm shift from reactive crisis management to proactive journey orchestration [7-13].
Key elements include:
•
Multi-Stakeholder Governance Structure A National Ferry Coordination Committee is proposed, chaired by the Deputy Minister of Transportation, with members from ASDP, Port Authority, Police, Navy, and Local Government. This committee would be responsible for policy coordination, crisis management, and performance oversight, meeting weekly during peak seasons and monthly otherwise [14, 15]. Technical Working Groups for Technology Integration, Operations Optimization, Customer Experience, and Safety & Security are also suggested [16, 17].
•
Legal and Regulatory Updates Amendments to Transportation Law are necessary to establish a legal framework for mandatory slot compliance, authorize dynamic pricing, mandate data sharing among stakeholders, and define performance standards with penalty structures [16, 17]. Implementation regulations would cover slot allocation methodology, price regulation, emergency protocols, and environmental compliance [18, 19]. The 2024 Shipping Law already introduces stringent safety benchmarks, including mandatory real-time tracking systems and weather prediction requirements [20].
•
Data-Driven Decisions Leveraging the "goldmine" of data from the Ferizy application and daily operations for predictive analytics is crucial for accurate demand forecasting and efficient resource allocation [1-6]. This aligns with the principle of "Keputusan Berbasis Data" (Data-Based Decisions) [1].
•
Political Will and Rule Enforcement The implementation of an arrival time slotting system and vehicle filtering in buffer zones requires strict and uncompromising rule enforcement, demanding political and operational courage [1-6].
Societal Acceptance and Change Management
The successful integration of AI-enabled systems also depends heavily on public and staff acceptance and adaptation:
•
Addressing Resistance to Change The introduction of new AI-driven procedures and digital systems can face resistance from staff and customers, potentially causing delays in adoption, decreased customer satisfaction, and reduced operational efficiency [21, 22]. Mitigation strategies include a comprehensive 18-month change management program, early stakeholder engagement through co-creation workshops, incentive alignment for early adopters, and multi-channel communication campaigns with success stories [23, 24].
•
Public Education and Behavioral Change Massive and continuous public education campaigns are needed to encourage commuters to plan their journeys, purchase tickets in advance, and adhere to chosen time slots [1-6].
•
Dynamic Pricing Acceptance Dynamic pricing, an AI-enabled policy for demand management, is noted as potentially "unpopular" and carries a "MEDIUM-HIGH" risk of public rejection [1, 25, 26]. To mitigate this, a gradual introduction of price variance (e.g., starting with ±20%), transparent communication of pricing rationale, and social protection measures like subsidized slots for vulnerable groups are proposed [25, 26].
Ethical and Operational Safeguards for AI
Specific ethical and operational safeguards are proposed for the advanced AI models used in vessel trajectory prediction:
•
Bias Mitigation To address potential regional route biases in AI models, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) can be applied. Additionally, SHAP analysis is recommended for auditing attention heads to ensure fairness and accuracy [27].
•
Privacy Preservation For data handling, privacy is crucial. Federated learning is proposed to allow model training across shipping companies without sharing raw data. GDPR-compliant anonymization techniques, such as MMSI hashing, are to be implemented to protect sensitive information [27].
•
AI Fallibility and Fallback Protocols Recognizing that AI systems may sometimes produce predictions with low confidence (e.g., below 80%), especially in safety-critical scenarios like collision prediction, kinematic fallback models are to be triggered. Furthermore, human-in-the-loop verification is mandated for critical decisions to ensure safety [27].
Human Capital Development and Digital Literacy
Investment in human capital is vital to adapt to the digital transformation:
•
Staff Training Programs Substantial investment is required for staff training programs and the recruitment of new hires for specialized roles [28, 29]. This includes using AR/VR simulators for training port operators in handling emergency scenarios, such as simulating vessel evacuations [30].
•
Digital Literacy Programs for digital literacy, in partnership with institutions like BPSDM (Human Resources Development Agency), are essential to educate and train all stakeholders, including non-technology-savvy users like fishermen and commuters, on using new digital platforms like the Ferizy Super App [30, 31].
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Smart Port Hardware: Sensors and Cameras
The Smart Port Ecosystem incorporates various hardware types to enhance its operations [1].
Two Smart Port infrastructure hardware types include:
•
LiDAR Docking Sensors [1]: These sensors, with specifications like 905nm wavelength, 200m range, and ±2cm accuracy, are deployed at Dermaga columns to provide data on vessel distance and alignment, aiding in precise docking [1-3].
•
Thermal ANPR Cameras [1]: These cameras, with specifications like 4K@60fps and operational range from -40°C to 85°C, are deployed at buffer zone entrances [1, 4, 5]. They capture license plates and vehicle types, enabling real-time vehicle identification and traffic flow optimization [1, 4-6].
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Smart Port Ecosystem: Journey Orchestration for Congestion Prevention
The Smart Port Ecosystem is structured around a holistic, end-to-end framework that orchestrates the entire passenger journey to proactively prevent congestion, moving from reactive crisis management to proactive travel orchestration [1-10]. This framework encompasses four distinct phases, each with specific objectives and technological implementations [6, 9, 11-32]:
•
Phase 1: Pre-Journey (Digital Foundation at Home) [6, 9, 11-14, 17, 23, 29] This phase lays the foundation for congestion prevention by transforming the Ferizy application into a "Super App" [6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 17, 23, 33]. The app evolves beyond mere ticket purchasing to become a digital travel assistant that implements a mandatory Arrival Time Slotting system, requiring users to select a specific time window for their port arrival [6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 17, 23, 33]. It also provides dynamic real-time notifications about port conditions and suggests optimal departure times from home, integrating with real-time traffic data from services like Google Maps/Waze [6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 17, 23, 33, 34]. The app can display live capacity information (e.g., 95% full, suggesting a later arrival) [17, 23]. This phase leverages AI-powered slot optimization algorithms for demand distribution and includes features like departure time recommendations with 88% accuracy for 6-hour forecasts, weather alerts, and alternative route optimization for multi-modal planning [33-35]. The technical architecture for this phase includes cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure), mobile app development (React Native), microservices backend (Node.js/Python), databases (MongoDB/PostgreSQL), and integration with over 15 external services (payment, maps, weather) [36, 37].
•
Phase 2: Approaching Port (Smart Flow Management) [13, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 38, 39] The objective of this phase is to filter and regulate the flow of vehicles long before they reach the actual port gates [18, 24]. This is achieved through the deployment of Variable Message Signs (VMS) on toll roads, which are integrated with port data to display messages guiding or diverting vehicles based on port congestion [15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 38, 39]. Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras are installed in designated buffer zones (e.g., at Rest Area KM 43, 38, 32) to automatically scan vehicle license plates and cross-reference them with booked arrival slots via the Ferizy system [15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 38-41]. Vehicles arriving too early are held in the buffer zone, while those aligned with their slots are allowed to proceed [15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 38, 39]. This phase utilizes an integrated Queue Management System connecting VMS, ANPR, and Ferizy data to create a smart virtual queuing system [18, 24]. Infrastructure for buffer zones includes 25 hectares with capacity for 3,500 vehicles, segmented areas based on departure time slots, and amenities like food courts, fuel stations, and Wi-Fi [42-44].
•
Phase 3: In-Port Operations (Maximum Efficiency) [13, 15, 16, 19, 21, 22, 25, 27, 28, 31, 38, 39] This phase represents the heart of efficient port operations [19, 25]. It involves operational automation through the implementation of a Smart Docking System equipped with IoT sensors (laser and radar) to monitor vessel position, wind speed, and tidal conditions, thereby accelerating vessel berthing and ensuring safer, more precise docking [15, 19, 21, 25, 27, 31, 38, 39, 45]. Automated Vehicle Marshalling systems use LED lights embedded in the pavement and VMS inside the port to guide vehicles to their designated lanes and parking areas for efficient loading [15, 19, 21, 25, 27, 31, 38, 39, 46]. A central Port Command Center, powered by AI, provides a real-time dashboard to monitor all operations, predict potential congestion hours in advance (2-3 hours), and simulate mitigation scenarios [16, 19, 21, 25, 27, 34, 38, 39, 47]. The Command Center features a 180° curved display wall with 48 monitors, real-time demand forecasts, and AI-powered queue optimization for dynamic lane allocation and priority management [46-48].
•
Phase 4: Onboard & Voyage (Fleet Reliability) [13, 16, 20, 22, 26, 28, 32, 49, 50] Efficiency at sea is as crucial as on land [20, 26]. This phase focuses on fleet reliability through predictive maintenance [16, 20, 22, 26, 28, 49, 50]. Sensors on vessel engines continuously transmit performance data, which is then analyzed by Predictive Maintenance Software to forecast potential equipment failures before they occur [16, 20, 22, 26, 28, 32, 49-51]. This allows for scheduled repairs, reducing incidents of sudden breakdowns that cause critical delays [16, 20, 22, 26, 28, 49, 50]. Additionally, centralized Fleet Management Systems track vessel position, speed, and fuel consumption to optimize routes and scheduling, potentially reducing fuel consumption by 20% and vehicle idle time by 60% through smart traffic management [20, 26, 52, 53]. This phase also includes AI-powered maintenance scheduling with 87% accuracy for 72-96 hour advance warnings [32].

•
Ignoring Environmental Dynamics: A notable limitation is that 90% of AI models disregard crucial hydrological factors such as currents and waves, which can impact trajectory accuracy by 2.8 nautical miles per hour [1].
•
Bias in AI Models: AI models can develop regional route biases, necessitating ethical and operational safeguards like reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to correct these biases, and SHAP analysis for auditing attention heads [2].
•
AI Fallibility and Need for Fallback Protocols: AI systems may sometimes produce predictions with low confidence (e.g., below 80%), especially in safety-critical scenarios like collision prediction. This requires the implementation of kinematic fallback models and human-in-the-loop verification for critical decisions to ensure safety [2].
II. Societal Impacts and Risks of AI-Enabled Systems (Implementation Challenges & User Reception)
A. Immediate/Short-Term Risks and Impacts:
•
Public Rejection of Dynamic Pricing: Dynamic pricing, a policy enabled by AI algorithms for demand distribution, is considered "unpopular" and carries a "MEDIUM-HIGH" risk of public rejection [3, 4]. Such rejection could lead to revenue shortfalls, political backlash, and even the reversal of regulations [3, 4]. Mitigation strategies include gradual price variance introduction (e.g., starting with ±20% variance), transparent communication, and social protection measures like subsidized slots for vulnerable groups [4, 5].
•

This ultimately aims to create a "smart mobility corridor" for the region [15, 17-21, 28, 29].
•
Potential for Autonomous Operations: The long-term roadmap includes the possibility of achieving carbon-neutral operations and eventually autonomous ferry operations with minimal human intervention, representing a fundamental shift in maritime transport [28, 29].
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Smart Port Ecosystems: A Technological Transformation
Technology is central to transforming traditional ports into Smart Port Ecosystems, proactively managing mobility from end-to-end to address systemic issues like severe congestion [1-13]. This shift moves from reactive crisis management to proactive journey orchestration, focusing on efficiency, predictability, and transparency [2, 4, 6, 7, 13, 14].
Here's how technology improves port efficiency:
•
Overarching Systems and Data Management
◦
Port Command Center (PCC): A centralized AI-supported dashboard that provides real-time monitoring of all operations, including vehicle numbers in parking areas, dock status, and vessel ETAs [15-23]. It can predict potential congestion hours in advance and simulate mitigation scenarios [15, 17-24]. This system helps port operators make data-driven decisions quickly [16, 19, 21, 23].
◦
Data-Driven Decisions & Analytics: Leveraging vast amounts of data from sources like the Ferizy application and daily operations for predictive analytics [25-31]. This includes using Machine Learning models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to accurately forecast passenger demand and potential congestion, with an accuracy of over 92% for 72-hour predictions [31-34]. The collected data can reach 2.8 TB per day with a collection frequency of 30 seconds for critical data, and a latency of less than 5 seconds for real-time processing [34, 35].
◦
Digital Twin: Platforms like Siemens Tecnomatix can create real-time virtual representations of the port, enabling simulations of various scenarios (e.g., dock closures, storms) to generate automatic mitigation plans and optimize resource allocation [19, 21, 23, 32, 36-39].
◦
Network Layer: A stable and fast connectivity infrastructure is essential. This includes 5G Private Networks for ultra-low latency (<10ms) real-time data synchronization between the command center and vessels, and VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) for offshore vessel monitoring [40-44]. LoRaWAN devices can provide extended battery life (10+ years) for marine-grade sensor networks [45].
◦
Security Layer: Implementing a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA), with components like Policy Decision Point (PDP) and Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), along with AES-256 encryption, protects data and infrastructure from cyber threats [40, 46-49]. This can lead to a significant reduction in cyber attacks, as seen in PSA Singapore which reduced attacks by 70% [33].
•
Pre-Journey & Traffic Management (Before and Approaching Port)
◦
Ferizy Super App Evolution: The existing Ferizy app is envisioned to become a "Super App" for mobility [1, 3, 5, 8-10, 16, 50, 51]. This app would implement a mandatory arrival time slot selection system, ensuring passengers arrive at the port according to their schedule [1, 3, 5, 8-10, 50, 51]. It would also provide dynamic real-time notifications on port conditions and suggest optimal departure times from home, integrated with real-time traffic data from Google Maps/Waze [1, 3, 5, 8-10, 16, 50-52].
◦
Intelligent Traffic Control Systems: Variable Message Signs (VMS) deployed on highways and Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras at buffer zones are used to filter and manage vehicle flow before they reach the port entrance [15, 17, 20, 22, 53-58]. Vehicles arriving too early can be held in buffer zones, while those within their time slot are allowed to proceed [15, 17, 20, 22, 54-56]. ANPR systems boast ≥98% recognition accuracy and process data in under one second [53, 58, 59].
◦
Advanced Queue Management: AI-powered systems optimize queue dynamics, including dynamic lane allocation based on vessel schedules and priority management for emergency vehicles or time-sensitive cargo. This also includes predictive queuing that notifies customers hours before boarding, improving customer experience [60, 61].
•
In-Port Operations (Efficiency Maximization)
◦
Smart Docking System: Docks are equipped with IoT sensors (e.g., LiDAR, radar) to monitor vessel position, wind speed, and tide conditions, enabling faster and safer berthing procedures [15, 17, 19-22, 54, 62, 63]. This can reduce docking time by up to 47% [64].
◦
Automated Vehicle Marshalling: Using LED lights embedded in the pavement and VMS within the port, this system automatically guides vehicles to the correct lanes and parking slots for loading onto specific ferries [15, 17, 19-22, 54, 62, 63]. This can improve loading efficiency by up to 300% [63, 65].
◦
Automated Parking: Robotic systems can be used for motorcycle and small car parking to further optimize space and loading processes [24, 63].
•
At Sea & Fleet Reliability
◦
Predictive Maintenance: Sensors on vessel engines continuously transmit performance data to an AI system that analyzes it to predict potential breakdowns before they occur [18, 25, 26, 30, 66-69]. This allows for scheduled repairs, reducing sudden delays and preventing fatal incidents [18, 25, 26, 30, 67, 68]. It can lead to a 40% reduction in breakdowns and an estimated Rp 89 billion/year in maintenance cost reduction [25, 69, 70]. This also improves spare parts management with just-in-time inventory and 98% availability [25, 69, 71].
◦
Fleet Optimization System: This system monitors fuel consumption in real-time, optimizes routes based on weather and current conditions to minimize delays and fuel use, and enables dynamic schedule adjustments and vessel reallocation for capacity optimization [71, 72].
•
Policy Innovation: Dynamic Pricing
◦
Dynamic pricing is considered a "game changer" for demand management [25, 73, 74]. It involves fluctuating ticket prices based on demand, with higher prices during peak hours and popular days, and lower prices during off-peak times [25, 26, 28, 73-77].
◦
This pricing strategy serves as the most effective incentive to naturally distribute traffic, motivating price-sensitive travelers to shift their departure times to less congested periods [25, 26, 28, 76, 77]. Examples like Garuda Indonesia and the Dover-Calais ferry system have successfully used dynamic pricing for demand smoothing [33, 65]. The pricing algorithm can be based on booking velocity and capacity, with up to a 400% variation from the base price for extreme peak management [73, 74].
•
Overall Benefits and Impact
◦
The implementation of these technologies is projected to lead to a 76% reduction in average wait times (from 8.7 hours to 2.1 hours) [64, 78, 79].
◦
It significantly improves predictability of journeys from 45% to 85% [79, 80].
◦
Overall operational efficiency gains are estimated at 40% through automation [79, 80].
◦
Economic benefits include Rp 680 billion/year in additional revenue from increased efficiency and Rp 420 billion/year from dynamic pricing premium revenue [70, 81].
◦
Cost savings are substantial, with Rp 125 billion/year in fuel savings from fleet optimization and Rp 89 billion/year from reduced maintenance [70, 82].
◦
Environmental benefits include a 35% reduction in carbon footprint through optimization and fuel consumption reduction by 20% [25, 83, 84].
◦
The total investment for these digital and physical infrastructure enhancements is estimated at Rp 4.2 trillion over three years, with projected annual benefits of Rp 3.1 trillion, leading to a payback period of 4.2 years [85, 86].
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Predictive Maintenance in Smart Port Ecosystems
Predictive maintenance is a crucial element of the Smart Port Ecosystem, particularly in the "At Sea & Voyage" phase, aiming to enhance the reliability and optimization of the ferry fleet [1-8].
Here are the key benefits of predictive maintenance:
•
Prevention of Breakdowns Before They Occur: Sensors on vessel engines continuously transmit performance data, which AI analyzes to predict potential breakdowns before they happen [1-8]. This capability allows for proactive intervention [1-8].
◦
AI-powered maintenance scheduling can provide a 72-96 hour advance warning with 87% accuracy of potential failures [8].
◦
This leads to a 40% reduction in breakdowns [9, 10].
•
Reduced Delays and Fatal Incidents: By predicting issues in advance, scheduled repairs can be performed, reducing sudden delays and preventing fatal incidents caused by vessel breakdowns [1-7].
◦
Predictive maintenance systems can reduce unexpected breakdowns by 41% [9].
•
Optimized Maintenance Scheduling and Cost Reduction:
◦
Maintenance can be scheduled proactively, allowing for cost-benefit analysis for repair vs. replace decisions [8].
◦
This leads to an estimated Rp 89 billion/year in maintenance cost reduction [11].
◦
It also improves spare parts management with just-in-time inventory and 98% availability [8].
•
Improved Fleet Availability and Reliability:
◦
By reducing unplanned downtime, the availability rate of the fleet improves (e.g., from 78% to a target of >90%) [12].
◦
Vessel reallocation can be optimized to compensate for capacity issues, improving emergency response capabilities [13].
•
Enhanced Operational Efficiency:
◦
Predictive maintenance contributes to the overall operational efficiency gains, which are projected to be 40% through automation [14, 15].
◦
It can extend equipment lifecycle by addressing issues before they become critical failures [16].
•
Environmental Benefits: By optimizing fuel consumption and minimizing idle time through predictive scheduling, the Smart Port Ecosystem can achieve a carbon footprint reduction of 35% [17, 18].
◦
Fuel optimization algorithms can reduce consumption by 20% [18].
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dynamic Pricing: Smart Port Traffic Management
Dynamic pricing is a key element of the envisioned Smart Port Ecosystem and a significant policy innovation aimed at improving traffic flow by naturally distributing demand [1-9]. It functions similarly to pricing models used by airlines or train services [1, 2, 4-7].
Here's how dynamic pricing improves traffic flow:
•
Concept and Mechanism [1-7, 9]:
◦
Ferry ticket prices would fluctuate based on demand [1, 2, 4-7].
◦
Higher prices would be set during peak hours and popular days (e.g., H-3 to H-1 Lebaran, evening departures between 16:00-22:00, or even Super Peak times like H-1, 22:00-02:00 with up to 400% of the base price) [1, 2, 4-7, 10].
◦
Lower prices would be offered during off-peak hours or less popular days (e.g., Super Off-Peak times like H-14 to H-8, 02:00-06:00, or Off-Peak between H-7 to H-4, 06:00-10:00) [1, 2, 4-7, 10].
◦
The pricing algorithm would be based on booking velocity and capacity [9], with demand elasticity modeling to understand price sensitivity [9, 11].
•
Achieving Traffic Distribution [1-8]:
◦
Dynamic pricing serves as the most effective incentive to naturally distribute traffic [1-7].
◦
Price-sensitive travelers would be motivated to depart during non-peak times to secure cheaper tickets [1, 2, 4-7].
◦
This distribution reduces the extreme pressure and congestion experienced during peak days, as traffic would be spread more evenly throughout the day and across the holiday period [1-7].
◦
For example, in the Ferizy Super App, mandatory arrival time slot selection can feature dynamic pricing (50-300% variation based on demand), optimized by AI for demand distribution [12-14]. The Dover-Calais ferry system successfully uses dynamic pricing for demand smoothing [8, 15].
•
Implementation and Challenges [1-7]:
◦
While highly effective from a system management perspective, dynamic pricing can be considered unpopular and requires careful consideration and political courage to implement [1-7].
◦
A phased approach is recommended, starting with limited implementation (e.g., 30% capacity with dynamic pricing) for pilot programs, coupled with extensive customer education campaigns to build acceptance [10, 16].
◦
The implementation roadmap includes gradually expanding coverage to 70% capacity with refined algorithms and eventually full implementation for 100% coverage [10, 16-19].
◦
Mitigation strategies for potential public rejection include gradual price variance introduction (e.g., starting with ±20% variance), transparent communication of the pricing rationale, and social protection measures like subsidized slots for vulnerable groups [20, 21].
Ultimately, dynamic pricing is seen as a "game changer" for demand management, contributing to a significant reduction in peak hour congestion [19, 22-24].

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dynamic Ferry Pricing: Concept to Full Implementation
Dynamic pricing is proposed as a game-changer for demand management in the ferry system, aiming to distribute traffic naturally and reduce congestion, particularly during peak periods [1-5].
Here's how dynamic pricing is envisioned to be implemented:
1.
Concept and Methodology [5]:
◦
Pricing Algorithm Design: * Base Price Determination: The base price will be determined using a cost-plus approach with competitive analysis [5]. * Demand Elasticity Modeling: Historical data analysis will be used to understand price sensitivity, allowing the system to predict how demand will change with price adjustments [5]. * Real-time Adjustment: The pricing algorithm will adjust prices in real-time based on booking velocity and current capacity [5]. * Maximum Variance: There will be a maximum variance, potentially up to 400% of the base price, for extreme peak management [5].
◦
Pricing Tiers [6]: Ticket prices will fluctuate based on demand, similar to airlines or trains, using different tiers: * Super Off-Peak: For instance, 02:00-06:00 (H-14 to H-8) could be priced at Base Price × 0.7 [6]. * Off-Peak: For example, 06:00-10:00 (H-7 to H-4) could be priced at Base Price × 0.9 [6]. * Regular: Like 10:00-16:00 (H-3 to H-2), priced at Base Price × 1.0 [6]. * Peak: Such as 16:00-22:00 (H-1 to H+1), priced at Base Price × 2.5 [6]. * Super Peak: For instance, 22:00-02:00 (H-1) could be priced at Base Price × 4.0 [6].
2.
Implementation Roadmap [6-9]:
◦
Phase 1: Pilot Program (6 months): * Limited Implementation: Dynamic pricing will be introduced for 30% of the capacity [6]. * A/B Testing: A control group with fixed pricing will be used for comparison [6]. * Customer Education: An extensive campaign will be launched to build public acceptance [6]. * Performance Measurement: Key metrics like demand distribution, revenue, and customer satisfaction will be measured [6]. * Expected outcome: Dynamic pricing pilot program (30% capacity) [8].
◦
Phase 2: Gradual Rollout (12 months): * Expanded Coverage: The system will expand to cover 70% of capacity with refined algorithms [6]. * Integration: Cross-platform pricing will be integrated with hotels, transport, and tourism services [6]. * Partnership Program: Corporate rates will be offered to logistics companies [6]. * Social Impact Mitigation: Subsidized slots may be offered to low-income families [6]. * Expected outcome: Dynamic pricing acceptance rate >70% [9].
◦
Phase 3: Full Implementation (18 months): * Complete Coverage: 100% dynamic pricing will be implemented, including advanced features like auction-based pricing for premium slots [7, 9]. * Market Expansion: Dynamic pricing will be extended to secondary routes [7]. * International Benchmarking: Performance will be compared with global standards [7]. * Expected outcome: 100% dynamic pricing implementation [9].
3.
Why it's a Systemic Solution [1-3]:
◦
Dynamic pricing is considered the most effective way to distribute traffic naturally [1-3].
◦
Passengers who are price-sensitive will be motivated to travel during off-peak times (when prices are lower), while those who prioritize specific travel times will be willing to pay more for peak slots [3]. This helps to spread out demand and reduce pressure on peak days [1-3].
4.
Challenges [1-3, 10]:
◦
The primary challenge is that dynamic pricing can be perceived as unpopular [1-3].
◦
It requires in-depth study, political courage for execution, and a gradual introduction (e.g., starting with ±20% variance) [3, 10].
◦
Transparency in communication and social protection measures, such as subsidized slots for vulnerable groups, are crucial for public acceptance [10].

It can predict potential congestion hours in advance and simulate mitigation scenarios [26, 27, 30, 32, 34, 35, 37-39].
•
Fase 4: Di Atas Kapal & Pelayaran (At Sea - Fleet Reliability) [38, 40-46]: This phase ensures efficiency and reliability during the actual voyage.
◦
Predictive Maintenance: Sensors on vessel engines continuously transmit performance data for analysis, enabling the prediction of potential breakdowns before they occur. This allows for scheduled repairs, significantly reducing incidents of vessels breaking down suddenly and causing delays [38, 40-46]. AI-powered maintenance scheduling can provide 72-96 hours of advance warning with 87% accuracy [46].
◦

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indonesia's Ferry Crisis: Causes, Impacts, and Safety Failures
The current problems in ferry operations, particularly in critical corridors like Merak-Bakauheni, are not merely operational inconveniences but rather a deep-seated systemic crisis that leads to widespread paralysis [1-11]. This recurring annual phenomenon, often seen during major holiday seasons like Eid al-Fitr, Christmas, and New Year, is triggered by a drastic surge in passengers and vehicle congestion [1, 5-7, 9, 11-13].
The issues are multifaceted, stemming from various interconnected factors that result in significant economic, social, and humanitarian consequences [14-25].
Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the current problems:
1. Root Causes of the Systemic Crisis
The Merak-Bakauheni problem is more complex than just an overflowing number of passengers [26-28]. Several key factors contribute to this crisis:
•
Capacity-Demand Gap (Kesenjangan Kapasitas dan Permintaan): The dramatic increase in passenger volume during peak days vastly outstrips the available capacity of the ports and ferry fleet [14, 16, 19, 21, 23, 27, 28].
◦
Normal daily capacity is around 12,000 four-wheeled vehicles, but peak surges can reach 45,000-50,000 vehicles, representing a 375% increase [29, 30].
◦
This peak demand lasts for 5-7 consecutive days, with dermaga (dock) utilization rates hitting 150-200% above optimal capacity [29, 30].
◦
Approximately 65% of all journeys occur within a 72-hour window during peak seasons, and about 70% of departures are concentrated between 8:00 PM and 6:00 AM [31, 32].
•
Limited Physical Infrastructure (Infrastruktur Terbatas): Despite some expansions, the current infrastructure acts as a major bottleneck [14, 16, 21, 23, 27, 28, 33].
◦
Merak Port has 6 active docks with an optimal capacity of 8,000 vehicles/day, and a parking area of 15 hectares for 2,500 vehicles [31, 32]. Its main bottleneck is a single-point, four-lane access road [31, 32]. The passenger terminal, designed for 3,000 people, often overflows with 8,000+ during peak times [31, 32].
◦
Bakauheni Port has 4 active docks (optimal 6,000 vehicles/day) and a 12-hectare parking area for 2,000 vehicles, also facing limitations from its access road merging with the national highway [34, 35].
•
Operational Flow Management Complexity (Manajemen Alur Operasional): Even with online ticketing, ensuring passengers arrive at the port according to their scheduled times remains a challenge [14, 16, 21, 23, 27, 28, 33].
◦
The average loading/unloading time per vessel is 45-60 minutes, far from the optimal 30 minutes, due to driver indiscipline and suboptimal layouts [34, 35]. Dock efficiency is only 65%, compared to an international standard of 85-90% [34, 35].
◦
"Go-show" rates (on-site ticket purchases, which are now eliminated with 100% digital ticketing using Ferizy [36]) were historically 30-40% [34, 37]. Current challenges include only 45% on-time arrival accuracy and a 15-20% no-show rate during peak slots [34, 37].
•
External Factors and Operational Risks (Faktor Eksternal dan Risiko Operasional):
◦
Adverse Weather Conditions: Bad weather in the Sunda Strait can force authorities to delay or cancel sailings for safety [14, 16, 21, 23, 27, 28, 33, 37]. Historically (2019-2024), there are 45-60 disruption days per year, leading to 8-12% schedule cancellations during peak seasons [37, 38]. Critical wave heights (>1.5 meters) or wind speeds (>25 knots) trigger automatic cancellations [37, 38].
◦
Vessel Reliability and Maintenance: Technical issues or breakdowns can suddenly reduce operational capacity [14, 16, 21, 23, 27, 28, 33]. The average age of ASDP's 48 active vessels is 18 years (optimal <15 years), and the sudden breakdown rate is 12% per month [25, 38]. The fleet's availability rate is 78%, below the target of >90% [25].
•
Traveler Behavior (Perilaku Pemudik): The concentration of journeys during preferred peak times (e.g., H-3 to H-1 before Eid al-Fitr) creates extreme congestion that is difficult to manage [14, 16, 21, 23, 27, 28, 32, 39].
2. The Domino Effect of Delays
A single ferry schedule delay is not an isolated incident; it acts as the first stone in a domino effect that cripples the entire system, from inside the port gates to outward on the toll roads [40-45].
•
Stage 1: Bottleneck at the Dock: A dock can only serve one vessel at a time. If a ship is late arriving or departing, that dock becomes unproductive, forcing subsequent vessels to wait in surrounding waters [41, 43, 45].
•
Stage 2: Accumulation within the Port Area: Vehicles scheduled for the delayed vessel fill the limited parking pockets and waiting areas inside the port, which are designed for temporary holding, not long-term parking. As more vehicles for subsequent schedules arrive, these areas quickly overflow [41, 43, 45].
•
Stage 3: Congestion Spills Out: Once the internal waiting areas are saturated, port authorities slow or halt incoming vehicles. This creates queues at the ticket gates that spill out onto access roads leading to the port [41, 43, 45].
•
Stage 4: Total Gridlock on Artery Roads and Tolls: The queues extend further, reaching main arterial roads and eventually toll roads (e.g., Tangerang-Merak Toll Road or Trans-Sumatra Highway near Bakauheni). At this point, the congestion impacts not only ferry passengers but also local traffic unrelated to the port [41, 43, 45].
3. Multidimensional Impacts
These delays and long queues cause significant negative impacts that extend far beyond mere inconvenience [15, 20, 22]:
•
Economic Losses:
◦
Direct Losses: Hours or even days of waiting lead to fuel waste (e.g., Rp 486 billion per season from 150,000 vehicles idling for an average of 18 hours [18, 25]), lost productive time (e.g., Rp 1.296 trillion from 28.8 million hours wasted [18, 46]), and cargo damage (e.g., 25-40% spoilage of 15,000 tons of sensitive cargo, totaling Rp 225 billion in losses [46, 47]).
◦
Indirect Losses: Supply chain disruptions, such as 3-5 day delays for FMCG distribution, cause commodity price increases (15-25% in Sumatra) and losses for manufacturing industries (Rp 340 billion) [46, 47]. There's also an estimated USD 45 million impact on exports [46].
•
Social and Humanitarian Impacts:
◦
Pedestrian Passengers (25% of total): Trapped in crowded terminals (8,000+ people in a 3,000-person capacity terminal), facing critical sanitation conditions (1:200 toilet ratio) and extreme fatigue, especially for vulnerable groups like children and the elderly (30% of passengers) [47, 48].
◦
Private Vehicle Users (45% of total): Their vehicles become "prisons" for 24-36 hours, leading to 400% additional fuel consumption, increased risk of engine overheating, and severe psychological and physical stress [48, 49].
◦
Inter-city Buses (15% of volume, 40% of passengers): Each stranded bus impacts dozens of passengers, derailing schedules and potentially forcing drivers to exceed safe working hours, increasing accident risk due to fatigue [49-52]. Industry satisfaction ratings drop by 45% [52].
◦
Logistics Trucks (15% of volume, largest economic impact): As carriers of vital goods, they face risks of damage or spoilage of sensitive cargo (35% of total value for 120,000 tons affected), incurring late delivery fines (Rp 156 billion), and disrupting "just-in-time" manufacturing for hundreds of factories (340 factories) [49, 52-54].
•
Safety and Security Risks: Prolonged accumulation of masses and vehicles increases the potential for friction, security issues, and health risks [15, 20, 22].
4. Alarming Safety Record
Beyond operational efficiency, Indonesia's ferry sector faces a severe safety challenge. Indonesia accounts for 56% of global ferry accidents, with 645 ferry accidents since 2000 resulting in 33,000 deaths [55-57]. Major disasters, like the 2018 KM Sinar Bangun tragedy (164 deaths due to overloading), highlight persistent regulatory enforcement gaps [56]. Despite recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT), only 10% are implemented by the Ministry of Transportation and local governments, a stark contrast to aviation industry implementation rates [56]. Overcrowding, incomplete passenger manifests, and inadequate life-saving equipment remain persistent issues [58].
In essence, the "ferry schedule delay" is a trigger for a systemic crisis that exponentially impacts millions, transforming what should be a few hours' journey into days of suffering, with real economic, social, and safety consequences on a national scale [59-61].

Orchestrating Seamless Ferry Journeys: A Proactive Solution
Providing holistic and end-to-end solutions for ferry delays, particularly in critical corridors like Merak-Bakauheni, means transitioning from a reactive crisis management approach to a proactive, orchestrated journey management [1-6]. This systemic crisis requires a systemic solution that manages the entire passenger journey from start to finish, preventing congestion from occurring in the first place [1, 3-6]. The core philosophy shifts from an asset-centric, siloed operation to a customer-centric ecosystem with integrated operations, prioritizing predictability, transparency, adaptability, efficiency, and resilience [6, 7].
Here's how to provide such comprehensive solutions, broken down by phases of the journey and supporting pillars:
I. Shifting the Paradigm: From Reactive to Proactive OrchestrationThe fundamental solution involves changing the operational paradigm from merely "managing congestion after it happens" to actively "preventing accumulation from the outset by orchestrating the entire passenger journey" [1-6]. This means PT ASDP Indonesia Ferry and other stakeholders evolve from simply port and vessel operators to Mobility Managers for the Java-Sumatra corridor [2, 5].
II. End-to-End Solution Framework: Orchestrating Java-Sumatra MobilityThis proactive solution framework touches every phase of a traveler's journey, transforming the port into a Smart Port Ecosystem [8-13].
•
**Phase 1: Pre-Journey (Digital Foundation at Home)**This is where the foundation for congestion prevention is laid [14, 15].
◦
Evolution of the Ferizy App into a "Super App": This application should not just sell tickets, but become a digital travel assistant [8-12, 14-17]. * Mandatory Arrival Time Slotting: Users must select a specific time slot for their arrival at the port when purchasing a ticket, not just the sailing time [8-12, 14-16, 18, 19]. This slot can have dynamic pricing variations (e.g., 50-300% based on demand) and be optimized by AI [18, 19]. * Real-time and Dynamic Notifications: The app provides continuous updates on port conditions, potential delays, and even suggested departure times from home, integrated with real-time traffic data (e.g., Google Maps/Waze API) [8-12, 14-16, 19, 20]. * Live Capacity Information: Displaying real-time port occupancy (e.g., 95% full, advised to arrive later) [14, 15]. * Advanced Booking Analytics: Using historical data, the system can predict no-shows with 91% accuracy and optimize dynamic pricing per customer segment [21, 22].
•
**Phase 2: Approaching the Port (Smart Flow Management on Roads & Tolls)**The goal is to filter and regulate vehicle flow far before they reach the port gates [22-30].
◦
Variable Message Signs (VMS) on Toll Roads: Integrated with port data, these signs display messages guiding vehicles (e.g., diverting to rest areas or instructing specific slot times to proceed) [21-30]. Twelve VMS units are recommended along the Tangerang-Merak Toll Road [21, 22].
◦
Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) Cameras in Buffer Zones: Located at strategic points (e.g., KM 43, 38, 32), ANPR cameras automatically scan license plates and cross-reference them with Ferizy ticket data. Vehicles arriving too early for their slot are held in buffer zones, while those on schedule are allowed to proceed [21, 23-32]. These systems boast >99% recognition accuracy and <2 seconds processing speed per vehicle [31, 32].
◦
Integrated Queue Management System: Software connecting VMS, ANPR, and Ferizy ticket data to create a smart virtual queuing system [24, 27].
◦
Buffer Zone Management: Requires a total area of 25 hectares with capacity for 3,500 vehicles, segmented into 6 areas based on departure time slots, offering amenities and 24/7 CCTV monitoring [31, 33, 34].
•
**Phase 3: Inside the Port (Maximal Efficiency)**This is the operational heart where efficiency is paramount [23, 25, 26, 28, 30, 35-38].
◦
Automated Operations: * Smart Docking System: Docks equipped with IoT sensors (laser and radar) monitor vessel position, wind speed, and tide conditions to accelerate and ensure safer berthing, with robotic mooring systems achieving 50% faster turnaround [23, 25, 26, 28, 30, 35-39]. Port of Rotterdam achieved a 47% reduction in docking time using LiDAR + AI guidance [40]. * Automated Vehicle Marshalling: LED floor guidance (e.g., 2.5 km of LED strips) and VMS inside the port automatically guide vehicles to the correct lanes and parking pockets based on their target vessel, reducing confusion and speeding up loading [23, 25, 26, 28, 30, 35-39, 41]. Singapore's PSA Port achieved 300% faster loading efficiency with automated vehicle marshalling [13, 42].
◦
Port Command Center (PCC): A centralized AI-powered dashboard monitoring all operations in real-time [23, 25, 28, 30, 35-37, 41, 43-45]. It can predict potential congestion 2-3 hours ahead and simulate mitigation scenarios, utilizing technologies like Grafana or Kibana for visualization [20, 23, 25, 28, 30, 35-37, 41, 44, 45].
◦
Advanced Queue Management: AI-powered optimization for dynamic lane allocation, priority management, and load balancing across berths [46, 47]. Digital queue numbers and estimated boarding times with ±15 minutes accuracy can enhance customer experience [43, 47].
•
**Phase 4: Onboard & Voyage (Fleet Reliability)**Efficiency at sea is as crucial as on land [44, 48-55].
◦
Predictive Maintenance: IoT sensors (e.g., vibration sensors for engines, ultrasonic for hull integrity) continuously send performance data to be analyzed by software to predict potential equipment failures before they occur [44, 48-56]. This allows for scheduled repairs, reducing sudden vessel breakdowns that cause fatal delays [44, 48-55, 57]. Singapore PSA Port cut breakdowns by 41% using predictive maintenance [40].
◦
Centralized Fleet Management: Systems track vessel position, speed, and fuel consumption for route and scheduling optimization [49, 51, 57]. This includes dynamic fleet management for real-time schedule adjustments and vessel reallocation [58, 59].
III. Key Success Factors for Implementation: Beyond Technology AloneEven with advanced technology, success hinges on three fundamental supporting pillars [48, 50, 52, 54, 60].
1.
Data-Driven Decisions: ASDP holds a "goldmine" of data from Ferizy and daily operations. This data must be maximally utilized for predictive analytics to generate highly accurate demand forecasts for efficient resource allocation [48, 50, 52, 54, 60-63]. LSTM models can predict passenger volume with 92% accuracy [64-66].
2.
Political Will and Rule Enforcement: The slotting system and buffer zone filtering require firm enforcement without compromise. Passengers arriving outside their slots must be strictly directed to buffer zones. This demands political and operational courage, alongside massive public education campaigns to change traveler behavior [48, 50, 52, 54, 60-63, 67].
3.
Policy Innovation: Considering Dynamic Pricing: Like the airline industry, implementing dynamic pricing (variable pricing) for ferry tickets—higher prices during peak hours and lower during off-peak—is considered the most effective incentive to naturally distribute traffic, reducing pressure during peak days [48, 50, 52, 54, 61-63, 67-69]. This, despite potential unpopularity, is a powerful system management tool [48, 50, 52, 54, 61-63, 67]. Garuda Indonesia successfully distributed flight traffic by 35% using dynamic pricing [65, 70].
These solutions aim to achieve significant improvements, such as a 76% reduction in average wait time (from 8.7 hours to 2.1 hours) and a 73% reduction in loading process time (from 45 minutes to 12 minutes), as shown in Ferizy simulation results [40]. International benchmarks, like the Dover-Calais Ferry System, demonstrate 94% on-time performance and 95% mandatory pre-booking, highlighting the potential for Indonesia [70, 71].
Ultimately, transforming the annual crisis at Merak-Bakauheni is a marathon, not a sprint, requiring substantial investment in technology, long-term commitment, and strong political will to reform the entire ecosystem [72-78]. The vision is to make the crossing predictable, efficient, and humane, turning a national frustration into a symbol of progress [72-78].

Indonesia's Ferry Crisis: A Systemic Breakdown
The recurring ferry delays at Indonesia's Merak and Bakauheni ports, especially during major holiday seasons like Eid al-Fitr, Christmas, and New Year, are not merely inconveniences but a systemic crisis that cripples the vital Java-Sumatra corridor [1-8]. This phenomenon is driven by a drastic surge in travelers that often far exceeds the available service capacity of ports and vessel fleets during peak times [5, 9].
The core issue lies in the "domino effect" triggered by even a single ferry delay [10-12]. The port system is designed for continuous flow, and any obstruction causes a cascade of problems:
•
Dermaga (Dock) Bottleneck: A single dock can only serve one vessel at a time for loading/unloading. If a ship is delayed in arrival or departure, the dock becomes unproductive, forcing subsequent vessels to wait offshore [13-15].
•
Penumpukan di dalam area pelabuhan (Buffer Zone Congestion): Vehicles scheduled for the delayed vessel accumulate in the limited waiting areas within the port, quickly filling and overflowing these temporary holding spaces [13-15].
•
Kemacetan Meluber ke Luar Pelabuhan (Spillover Congestion): Once the internal waiting areas are saturated, authorities slow or stop vehicle entry, causing queues to form at the gates and extend onto access roads leading to the port [13-15].
•
Kelumpuhan Total di Jalan Arteri dan Tol (Total Gridlock): The queues extend further back, reaching main arterial roads and eventually major toll roads (such as the Tangerang-Merak Toll Road or Trans-Sumatra Highway near Bakauheni) [13-15]. At this point, the congestion impacts all traffic, not just ferry passengers [13-15].
This systemic crisis is rooted in several interconnected factors [16-23]:
•
Kesenjangan Kapasitas dan Permintaan (Capacity-Demand Gap):
◦
The number of travelers can increase by hundreds of percent during peak days compared to regular days [17, 20, 22].
◦
The existing capacity of port infrastructure (docks, parking areas) and the fleet of ferries cannot adequately meet this rapid surge in demand [16-18, 20-24].
◦
Normal daily capacity is 12,000 four-wheeled vehicles, but peak surges reach 45,000-50,000 vehicles, a 375% increase [25, 26]. Dock utilization can be 150-200% above optimal capacity [25, 26].
◦
65% of journeys occur within a 72-hour peak window, with 70% of departures concentrated between 8:00 PM and 6:00 AM [27, 28].
•
Infrastruktur Pelabuhan yang Terbatas (Limited Port Infrastructure):
◦
Despite expansions, the capacity of parking areas, number of docks, and the speed of loading/unloading processes become major bottlenecks during high traffic volumes [16-18, 20-24, 27].
◦
Merak Port has 6 active docks (optimal capacity 8,000 vehicles/day) and 15 hectares of parking (capacity 2,500 vehicles), with a single-point 4-lane access road as a main bottleneck [27, 28]. Passenger terminals often overflow (e.g., 3,000 capacity vs. 8,000+ actual) [27, 28].
◦
Bakauheni Port has 4 active docks (optimal capacity 6,000 vehicles/day) and 12 hectares of parking (capacity 2,000 vehicles), and its access roads merge with national roads, adding to congestion [29, 30].
◦
The average loading/unloading time is 45-60 minutes per vessel (optimal is 30 minutes), and dock efficiency is only 65% compared to international standards of 85-90% [29, 30].
•
Manajemen Tiket dan Alur Penumpang (Ticket and Passenger Flow Management):
◦
While online ticketing (Ferizy app) has been implemented to eliminate on-site purchases [31-34], the challenge remains in ensuring passengers arrive at the port according to their scheduled times [16-18, 20-24].
◦
The "go-show" rate (passengers without advance tickets) can be 30-40% (target <10%), and only 45% of passengers arrive on time for their slots [29, 35]. There's also a 15-20% no-show rate for peak slots [29, 35].
•
Faktor Cuaca dan Teknis (External and Technical Factors):
◦
Adverse weather conditions in the Sunda Strait (e.g., waves >1.5 meters, winds >25 knots) can force port authorities to delay or cancel sailings for safety [17, 20, 22, 35, 36]. Historically, weather disturbances cause 8-12% schedule cancellations during peak seasons [35, 36].
◦
Technical issues with vessels also reduce the number of operational ferries [16-18, 20-24]. ASDP's fleet has an average age of 18 years (optimal <15 years) and a sudden breakdown rate of 12% per month, leading to a 78% availability rate (target >90%) [36, 37].
•
Perilaku Pemudik (Traveler Behavior):
◦
The concentration of travelers choosing to depart at the same "favorite" times (e.g., H-3 to H-1 before Eid) creates extreme density that is difficult to manage [16-18, 20-23, 38].
These combined factors lead to multifaceted negative impacts, including economic losses (up to Rp 2.1 trillion per peak season) due to wasted fuel, delayed logistics, and lost productive time [37, 39-43]. There are also significant humanitarian impacts from physical and mental exhaustion, especially for vulnerable groups, and increased safety and security risks due to prolonged mass and vehicle accumulation [41, 42, 44-46]. For example, private vehicle users can be stuck for 24-36 hours, incurring 400% additional fuel consumption [46, 47]. Logistics trucks face damage or spoilage of sensitive cargo (25-40% loss), leading to total financial losses and disruptions to the entire supply chain [45, 48-51].
While the government and PT ASDP Indonesia Ferry have implemented various solutions such as Ferizy digital ticketing, adding capacity, traffic engineering (like buffer zones), and diversifying routes [31, 33, 34], these efforts have largely been reactive, akin to "firefighting" after congestion has already occurred [6, 19, 52-54]. This highlights the need for a fundamental paradigm shift from reactive crisis management to proactive, end-to-end travel orchestration to prevent congestion from occurring in the first place [6, 19, 52-54].
