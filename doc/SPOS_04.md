### Overlooked/Missed Details in SDLC Context:

1.  **Data Governance and Quality Management:**
    * **Detail:** The importance of Data Quality Assessment (DQA) tools like Apache Spark ML to clean noisy AIS data (15-30% noise) and H3 Geospatial Indexing for anomaly detection is critical for AI model accuracy. This needs dedicated SDLC activities for data profiling, cleansing, and validation, not just during initial ingestion but as an ongoing process.
    * **SDLC Integration:** Dedicated data quality sprints in Development, automated data validation pipelines in Deployment, and continuous data quality monitoring in Maintenance.

2.  **Interoperability Standards Adherence:**
    * **Detail:** Explicit adoption of ISO 11064 (command centers) and IEEE 2413-2019 (IoT integration) to ensure seamless communication across all systems (Ferizy App, PCC, ANPR). This impacts API design, data formats, and communication protocols.
    * **SDLC Integration:** Incorporate these standards into the Design phase (API specifications, data models) and enforce them during Development and Testing.

3.  **Legal and Regulatory Compliance Lifecycle:**
    * **Detail:** Beyond initial legal updates for slot compliance and dynamic pricing, the SDLC must account for ongoing changes in maritime law (e.g., 2024 Shipping Law, VDES mandates by 2028), data privacy regulations (GDPR-compliant anonymization), and cybersecurity mandates.
    * **SDLC Integration:** Establish a "Regulatory Compliance Review" gate in each phase, with legal and compliance teams reviewing designs, features, and deployment plans.

4.  **Change Management as an SDLC Parallel Stream:**
    * **Detail:** The 18-month change management program, public education campaigns (#MudikCerdas), stakeholder workshops, and incentives for adoption are crucial. This isn't just a "soft skill" but a parallel project stream affecting user adoption and project success.
    * **SDLC Integration:** Integrate change management activities and communication plans into sprint reviews and deployment schedules. User training modules (including AR/VR simulators for emergency scenarios) should be developed in parallel with software features.

5.  **Robust Fallback Mechanisms and Human-in-the-Loop:**
    * **Detail:** When AI confidence for predictions falls below 80% (especially for collision prediction), kinematic fallback models and human-in-the-loop verification are crucial for critical decisions. This implies specific design for manual overrides and alert systems.
    * **SDLC Integration:** Design and test these fallback protocols rigorously during Development and Testing phases, particularly in crisis simulation scenarios (Digital Twin).

6.  **Sustainable Software Engineering Practices:**
    * **Detail:** Integrate environmental benefits (e.g., 35% carbon footprint reduction, fuel optimization algorithms reducing consumption by 20%) into software design, focusing on energy efficiency of algorithms, cloud resource optimization, and data center efficiency.
    * **SDLC Integration:** Consider energy efficiency during architecture design, code optimization, and cloud deployment configuration. Track carbon emissions metrics (e.g., using SAP Green Ledger) in the Monitoring phase.

By meticulously following this comprehensive SDLC guideline and addressing these often-overlooked details, the SPOS project can successfully deliver a transformative Smart Port Ecosystem for Indonesia's ferry services.
