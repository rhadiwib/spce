I am working on a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a Web Dashboard Application called the Smart Port Command Center. Currently, I do not have access to the required real data sources, including AIS Data, Ferizy Data, and IoT Sensor Data. To move forward with the PoC, I am considering creating a simulation engine that uses fabricated or synthesized data to mimic these data sources.

Is this approach feasible? I need the simulation engine to accurately replicate the behavior of each data source, including their protocols, data formats/schemas, and any other relevant details essential for the dashboardâ€™s functionality. My aim is to ensure the simulated data behaves identically to the real data, enabling me to develop and test the dashboard effectively.

I am also concerned about potentially overlooking important details in the simulation. Could you provide guidance on how to ensure the simulation is comprehensive and includes all critical aspects of the real data sources? Please share your insights and recommendations on this approach, including any best practices or considerations for building the simulation engine for this PoC.
