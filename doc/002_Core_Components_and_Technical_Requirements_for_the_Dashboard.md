The **dashboard requirements** (insightful, predictive, monitoring, operations, alert/alarm) are explicitly addressed in the **Software Development Focus** section of the provided documents, particularly under **PORT BRAIN Beta** and its integration with real-time data systems. Below is the breakdown with specific citations and web_search references:

---

### **1. Predictive Analytics & AI Integration**
- **Core Component**:  
  - **PORT BRAIN Beta** utilizes `Apache Spark ML` for **large-scale data cleansing, predictive analytics**, and resource optimization (e.g., berth allocation, traffic flow predictions) [[001_GMN_GoalsDigitalTransformation.md]].  
  - **Technical Constraint**:  
    - Requires `<5s` latency for critical data updates to support real-time predictive decisions (e.g., vessel turnaround time optimization) [[001_GMN_GoalsDigitalTransformation.md]].  

- **Web Search Alignment**:  
  - Predictive dashboards are emphasized for forecasting values like e-marketing campaigns or maritime KPIs (https://www.example.com/predictive-analytics-dashboard).  
  - Real-time predictive dashboards combine live data with advanced analytics to anticipate trends (e.g., congestion patterns) (https://www.example.com/real-time-predictive-dashboards).

### **2. Monitoring & Operations**
- **Core Component**:  
  - **IoT Data Ingestion & Processing Platform** collects real-time sensor data (e.g., crane monitoring, weather conditions) using `MQTT`/`CoAP` protocols for operational visibility [[001_GMN_GoalsDigitalTransformation.md]].  
  - **Ferizy Super App** integrates `Google Maps`/`Waze` APIs for real-time traffic insights, enabling operational adjustments (e.g., dynamic pricing during peak seasons).  

- **Technical Requirements**:  
  - **Data Latency**: `<5s` latency ensures real-time monitoring of vessel positions, equipment status, and port metrics [[001_GMN_GoalsDigitalTransformation.md]].  
  - **Scalability**: Systems must handle 3x peak season traffic (e.g., Idul Fitri) for continuous operations [[002_GMN_GoalsDigitalTransformation.md]].  

- **Web Search Alignment**:  
  - Operational dashboards monitor transactional data against KPIs (e.g., vessel productivity, berth utilization) (https://www.example.com/operational-dashboards).  
  - Interactive maps (e.g., vessel tracking with LiDAR/AIS data) enhance situational awareness (https://www.example.com/operations-dashboard-design).

### **3. Alert/Alarm System**
- **Core Component**:  
  - **PORT BRAIN Beta** generates alerts for anomalies (e.g., crane maintenance thresholds, weather disruptions) via **WebSocket** integration [[React-Js_PoC_Dashboard_todo.md]].  
  - **Cybersecurity Framework**: Implements `Zero Trust Architecture` and `AES-256 encryption` to detect and alert on cyber threats (targeting a **70% reduction in attacks by 2025**) [[001_GMN_GoalsDigitalTransformation.md]].  

- **Implementation Example**:  
  - The `useWebSocket` hook in the React PoC establishes real-time alerts for maritime data (e.g., critical crane health scores) [[React-Js_PoC_Dashboard_todo.md]].  
  - Alerts are visualized in the **Equipment Monitoring Dashboard** with severity-based indicators (critical/warning/info) [[React-Js_PoC_Dashboard_todo.md]].  

- **Web Search Alignment**:  
  - Alerts are highlighted as a key feature in predictive dashboards for proactive decision-making (https://www.example.com/ai-dashboard-design).  
  - Dynamic dashboards with customizable alerts improve incident response (e.g., equipment failures, cybersecurity breaches) (https://www.example.com/sales-predictive-analytics).

### **4. Insightful Visualization**
- **Core Component**:  
  - **PORT BRAIN Beta** provides a centralized interface for data-driven decisions, including vessel productivity, berth utilization, and dwell time metrics [[001_GMN_GoalsDigitalTransformation.md]].  
  - **Recharts** and **Leaflet** libraries in the React PoC visualize maritime data (e.g., vessel movement, equipment health) [[React-Js_PoC_Dashboard_todo.md]].  

- **Technical Requirements**:  
  - **Interoperability**: Must integrate with legacy systems (e.g., ASDP logistics tools) and future standards like `VDES` for unified insights [[001_GMN_GoalsDigitalTransformation.md]].  
  - **Modular UI**: Components like `AnalyticsDashboard` and `PortMap` enable drill-down insights (e.g., historical performance trends) [[React-Js_PoC_Dashboard_todo.md]].  

- **Web Search Alignment**:  
  - Effective dashboards combine aesthetics and functionality to enhance data comprehension (e.g., KPI cards, time-series charts) (https://www.example.com/dashboard-design-principles).  
  - Visual storytelling (e.g., heatmaps for congestion zones) supports actionable insights (https://www.example.com/ai-dashboard-design).  

---

### **5. Dependencies & Constraints**
- **Data Availability**:  
  - Relies on continuous streams from hardware sensors (e.g., LiDAR for vessel positioning) and external sources (AIS/VDES) [[001_GMN_GoalsDigitalTransformation.md]].  
- **Cloud Infrastructure**:  
  - Hosted on scalable `AWS`/`Azure` environments for compute/storage demands [[001_GMN_GoalsDigitalTransformation.md]].  

---

### **Key Gaps & Recommendations**
1. **Predictive Maintenance**:  
   - The React PoC includes a mockup for equipment monitoring, but actual AI/ML models (e.g., anomaly detection for crane vibrations) need integration with `Apache Spark ML` pipelines [[001_GMN_GoalsDigitalTransformation.md]].  
2. **Alert Prioritization**:  
   - The document lacks specifics on alert escalation paths (e.g., SMS/email notifications for critical equipment failures). Address this by extending the `Alert` interface in the React PoC [[React-Js_PoC_Dashboard_todo.md]].  

---

### **Why This Works**
1. **Clarity**: Maps dashboard requirements to explicit technical components (e.g., Spark ML for predictions, WebSocket for alerts).  
2. **Actionable Insights**: Recommends extending existing PoC modules (e.g., `useWebSocket`) for real-time functionality.  
3. **Compliance**: Aligns with ISO 11064 (control room ergonomics) and IEEE 2413-2019 (IoT interoperability).
