For the development of a Proof of Concept (PoC) for our **Smart Port Command Center Web Dashboard Application**, we currently face a critical constraint: **lack of direct access to real-time production data** from key operational sources, specifically:

1.  **AIS (Automatic Identification System) Data:** Vessel positions, speeds, courses, identities, and estimated times of arrival (ETAs).
2.  **Ferizy Super App Data:** Ticket sales, booking patterns, passenger journey progress, and predicted no-shows.
3.  **IoT Sensor Data:** Real-time readings from LiDAR sensors (dock status, vessel positioning), ANPR cameras (vehicle counts, queue lengths), environmental sensors (weather, sea conditions, air/water quality, noise), and equipment health sensors (vibration, temperature, pressure for predictive maintenance).

To proceed with the PoC, we require a robust **Data Simulation Engine** capable of generating high-fidelity synthesized/fabricated data for all these sources.

The simulation engine must precisely mimic the **real-world behavior and technical characteristics** of this data, including:

* **Data Content & Patterns:** Realistic trends, seasonal variations (e.g., peak holiday traffic for Ferizy), common operational events (e.g., vessel arrivals/departures, docking procedures, cargo handling), and expected operational anomalies (e.g., loitering vessels, equipment malfunctions, congestion build-ups).
* **Data Volume & Velocity:** Scalable generation of data volumes representative of typical and peak port operations (e.g., 2.8 TB/day, 500K messages/sec for Kafka, 3x peak season traffic for Ferizy).
* **Technical Fidelity:** Exact replication of:
    * **Communication Protocols:** e.g., MQTT/CoAP for IoT sensors, AIS NMEA sentence structures for vessel data.
    * **Data Schemas & Formats:** Precise JSON, Avro, Protobuf, or other specified formats, including all relevant fields and their data types (e.g., vessel dimensions, cargo types, ticket classes, sensor units).
    * **Geospatial Behavior:** Realistic vessel trajectories, vehicle movements within defined port zones, and georeferenced sensor readings.
* **Realism of Imperfections:** Inclusion of realistic data noise, missing values, and inconsistencies (e.g., simulating the 15-30% noise/missing values in raw AIS data identified in our analysis).
* **Configurability:** Ability to configure and control specific simulation scenarios, scale data generation, inject predefined events/anomalies, and adjust data frequency/latency.

The ultimate purpose of this **Data Simulation Engine** is to serve as the live data provider for the backend of our **Smart Port Command Center Web Dashboard Application**. This will enable us to develop and rigorously test its core functionalities, including:

* **Real-time Monitoring & Visualization** (e.g., displaying KPI dashboards, live maps).
* **Predictive Analytics** (e.g., feeding AI models for congestion prediction, predictive maintenance).
* **Operational Control Simulation** (e.g., simulating dynamic orchestration, digital twin scenarios).
* **Alert/Alarm System** (e.g., triggering alerts based on simulated anomalies or thresholds).

Given these requirements, please provide a comprehensive approach or architectural design for building such a Data Simulation Engine, including recommended technologies, methodologies, and key considerations for ensuring the fabricated data effectively supports the development and validation of our Smart Port Command Center PoC.
