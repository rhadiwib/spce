## The Intelligent Heart of Indonesia’s Smart Ports: The Port Command Center (PCC)

The PCC dashboard is not merely a display of data; it is conceived as the "intelligent brain" of the Smart Port Ecosystem, situated within the **Application Layer** of the SPOS's multi-layered technology architecture. Its development is central to enabling data-driven decisions and proactive congestion prevention by orchestrating mobility and integrating operations across all stakeholders.

### Deep Dive into Core Components and Capabilities

The PCC dashboard integrates five key capabilities that render it insightful, predictive, and operationally indispensable:

#### 1. Insightful & Monitoring Capabilities (Real-Time Operations Dashboard)

The "monitoring" and "insightful" aspects are driven by the PCC's ability to collect, process, and visualize vast amounts of real-time operational data.

* **Data Sources and Types Displayed**: The PCC aggregates data from numerous sources including IoT sensors (LiDAR for dock monitoring, marine buoys for environmental conditions, vibration/temperature/oil quality sensors for vessels, vehicle counting, queue length detection, traffic sensors), ANPR cameras in buffer zones, GPS from vessels, CCTV feeds from critical areas, and external APIs (e.g., BMKG for weather, Google Maps/Waze for traffic). It displays real-time vehicle counts, dock availability, berthing times, loading/unloading durations, vessel Estimated Times of Arrival (ETAs) via AIS, weather and sea conditions (wind speed, wave height, visibility, 2-3 hour predictions), and live CCTV feeds. The dashboard will track over 200 KPIs, including capacity utilization and bottleneck analysis.
* **Visualization Tools**: Grafana and Kibana are explicitly recommended for displaying operational data and KPIs in dynamic graphical formats. Power BI is also mentioned as a recommendation. The React PoC utilizes Recharts and Leaflet libraries for visualization.
* **Physical Control Room Infrastructure**: The PCC control room should feature a 180° curved display wall with 48 monitors, adhering to ISO 11064 standards for 24/7 control room operations, including redundant power feeds and specialized air conditioning systems.

#### 2. Predictive Capabilities (with AI Analytics)

This functionality is a cornerstone, shifting operations from reactive to proactive.

* **AI/ML Models**: The PCC leverages various Machine Learning models, predominantly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for demand forecasting (e.g., predicting 300% surges with >90% accuracy for 72-hour predictions). Other models include Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost for vehicle deployment/vessel travel times; Reinforcement Learning for dynamic pricing optimization; Genetic Algorithms for route optimization; and Unsupervised Learning for anomaly detection. Transformer-based neural networks are also used for vessel trajectory prediction (95% accuracy for <2km predictions).
* **Specific Predictions**:
    * **Congestion Prediction**: Predicts potential congestion 2-3 hours in advance with >90% accuracy, leveraging historical data, national holidays, ticket purchasing trends (from Ferizy App), and highway traffic. Traffic simulation accuracy is targeted at 95%.
    * **Predictive Maintenance**: Forecasts equipment breakdowns on vessels with 87-89% accuracy, providing 72-96 hours of advance warning. This aligns with a target of 40% reduction in breakdowns.
    * **Predictive ETAs**: AI algorithms provide more accurate and dynamic vessel ETAs, reducing forecast errors by up to 30% and achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 5%.
    * **Anomaly Detection**: ML models identify deviations from normal vessel behavior (e.g., impossible speeds, loitering), cutting false alarms by 40%.
* **Digital Twin Integration**: The PCC incorporates a Digital Twin for "what-if" scenario simulations (e.g., dock closures, storms) to generate automatic mitigation plans and resource allocation optimization, potentially reducing human decision latency by 92%. Platforms like Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation, Unity 3D, or Unreal Engine are suggested.

#### 3. Operational Capabilities

This aspect refers to the PCC's ability to facilitate dynamic orchestration and management of port activities based on real-time data and predictive insights.

* **Real-Time Orchestration Engine**: Automates dispatch commands based on IoT sensor data, ANPR feeds, and weather alerts. For instance, it can reroute 30% of trucks to a less congested dock if prediction models show density exceeding 80%.
* **AI-Powered Queue Optimization**: Provides visual displays of vehicle flow with color-coding (green = smooth, red = congested) and recommends dynamic lane allocation and priority management.
* **Digital Twin Simulation**: Enables interactive simulation of "what-if" scenarios for automated mitigation planning, visualizing results in "Before vs. After Mitigation" graphs.

#### 4. Alert/Alarm System

Integrated within the PCC, this system provides timely notifications for critical events and deviations, enabling proactive responses.

* **Trigger Mechanisms**: Alerts are generated based on thresholds (e.g., congestion probability exceeding 80%), anomalies detected by AI models (e.g., impossible vessel speeds, loitering), and external events (e.g., equipment failures, sudden changes in weather/sea conditions).
* **Types of Alerts**: Include congestion alerts (2-3 hours in advance), system anomalies, equipment failures (from predictive maintenance), and environmental excursions (storms, high waves).
* **Notification Channels**: Alerts can be sent via SMS/email and displayed prominently on the PCC dashboard itself. Integration with Ferizy Super App for public notifications is also a feature. WebSocket integration is used for real-time alerts.

#### 5. Insightful User Experience (UI/UX)
